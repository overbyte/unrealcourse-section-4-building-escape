## Game Design

The design is simple: Find out how to open the doors to escape the room

### Game Loop

Find the interactable items in the level and see which ones will open the door
to allow the player to escape.

### Future Consideration

A good Win Message is needed and there could be some environmental work in the
level to make it feel less like a floating piece of geometry
